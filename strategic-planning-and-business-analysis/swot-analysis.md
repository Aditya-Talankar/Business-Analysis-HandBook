#### **The Four Elements of SWOT**

Let’s break down each component of SWOT and how to approach it:

**1. Strengths (S): What You Do Well**

Strengths are internal factors that give you an advantage. These are the things you excel at and can leverage to achieve your goals. Ask yourself:

* What resources, skills, or assets do we have?
* What do others see as our strengths?
* What sets us apart from the competition?

_Examples_: Experienced team members, strong brand reputation, efficient processes, loyal customer base.

**2. Weaknesses (W): Areas for Improvement**

Weaknesses are internal factors that hold you back. These are the areas where you struggle or lack resources. Be honest and objective when identifying weaknesses. Ask:

* What do we do poorly or not at all?
* Where do we lack resources or expertise?
* What do others see as our weaknesses?

_Examples_: Outdated technology, limited budget, lack of skilled personnel, inefficient workflows.

**3. Opportunities (O): External Possibilities**

Opportunities are external factors you can take advantage of to grow or improve. These are trends, changes, or openings in your environment that you can capitalize on. Ask:

* What trends or changes could benefit us?
* Are there new markets or technologies we can explore?
* What unmet needs can we address?

_Examples_: Emerging markets, advancements in technology, changes in regulations, gaps in the competition.

**4. Threats (T): External Challenges**

Threats are external factors that could harm your progress or success. These are risks or obstacles you need to prepare for. Ask:

* What challenges or risks do we face?
* Are there new competitors or economic changes that could impact us?
* What external factors are beyond our control?

_Examples_: New competitors, economic downturns, changing customer preferences, regulatory changes.
